# Batch-RPG

This Batch file must have original content only. Do not copy from any other games you see.
Everything in this game has been thought of by me (That I am aware of).

If a pull request has a bug or the code does not contribute to the effect I want the game
to have I will not go through with it.

If the code is not clean and easy-to-read I will not go through with the pull request.

Lastly, if you wish to have your name put in the credits tell me, do not submit a pull request.
I will put your name in the credits only if I feel you have earned it.
